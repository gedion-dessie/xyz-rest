# xyz-rest

A very simple demo of JAX-RS (REST) with Jersey implementation. It's a Spring + Hibernate project.

This is just to demonstrate how to use these technologies. This project doesn't have any validation, the right security measure and exception handling. 

I repeat, this is just a simple demo!
